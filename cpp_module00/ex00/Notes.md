# HOW C++ WORKS :

>**# :** Preprocessor statement (before compilation), it copies and pastes the header file into the working file.

>**iostream :** Header files.

>**main() :** Entry point. (Special case). If you didn't return anything, it assumes that you're returning **0**.

>**<< :** Overloaded operator, they work like a function, it pushes to the standard output.

>**OOP :** A style that you can adopt as to how you write your code.

>**CLASSES :** A way to group data or functionality together.
